#Readme for Barebones Spelling Bee
This is a bare bones iOS app based on the [FL Spelling Bee project](http://flspellingbee.co.uk) using their [publically accessible API](http://flspellingbee.co.uk/xml.xml). The source for this project is free under the Apache 2.0 License (see LICENSE).

##Building the source
I've intentionally designed this so that it doesn't depend on any extra libraries so that all you have to do is clone the repo and build in Xcode. I recommend that you do it in at least Xcode 4.5 (which, at the time of writing, is the latest one on the App Store) because that works. Note that currently there is no iPad support but it could be added at a later date.

I don't think that there is anything too complex in the source but the every file I've written more than a line of code in is commented so that it makes a bit more sense.

##Icons
I've included the SVG files for all the icons that I created (Home, Words, Practice and Settings). These look quite nice when rendered on the tab bar and are pretty simplistic. I threw them together in Inkscape in a couple of minutes. Feel free to use them in your own projects!

##Suggestions
This isn't an official app but if you reckon there should be any extra features please email them because they probably could get added. I would quite like to add the following:
* Analytics so that you can review which words you are particularly good/bad at
* Better accessibility support so that words could be read out
* Custom styling on tab/navigation bars?
* A slightly prettier UI in general although I guess the project is 'barebones' and is designed to be built on. Feel free to fork and improve the design!
